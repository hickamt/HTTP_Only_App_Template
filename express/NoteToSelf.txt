Issue, when authenticating the localhost:5500/refresh should use
the /auth cookie to allow a new authentication token to be created.

This is not working and getting code 401 unauthorized
coming from /controllers/refreshTokencontroller.js about line 17.

Probable issue is that I need to set up a {variable} within Thunder Client to allow
the authentication token and cookies to be inherited in some way.

Check the final github repo and insure that the following have the same code:
* file names
* require() routes
* middleware
* and controllers

- completed code: https://github.com/gitdagray/express_jwt

NEXT STEPS:
Need to create the Client side registration and login using JWT and httpCookie only.
This app should allow requests to the server API endpoints using the AuthenticationToken and
create new AuthTokens using the refreshToken API.
